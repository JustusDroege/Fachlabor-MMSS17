A manufacturing company needs a pressure sensor for monitoring the gas pressure in a low-pressure pneumatic system. We were provided with some requirements the sensor has to meet. We set on developing the sensor. First, we create a morphological chart to create a basic outline for the sensor needs. Then, we create a parametric model of the sensor in modeling software such as SOLIDWORKS, and simulate it using FEM. After that we done some calculation about the design of sensor with the help of mathematical formulas. Then we designed a circuit to go along with the sensor to carry out the process, then, a simulation of the circuit is done on PSpice to see the feasibility of the circuit. Then a model of the board layout and circuit connection was done using EAGLE software. Finally the board was printed out, etched and all the parts are soldered and was checked if it satisfied the needs.
